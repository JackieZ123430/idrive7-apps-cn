/*
 * Embed mode's display: the HMI's embedded compositor (HmiMain3D, wayland-1). The page template
 * (js/hmi_template.js) draws ivi surface `id` inside an app's page, stretched over its box; the
 * renderer draws the shown app there through buffers of the box's size. The surface exists
 * only while an app is shown, so another app's page with the template shows nothing of ours.
 *
 * Two kinds of buffer, both XRGB8888 rows top-down, one kind per connection (the compositor shows a GPU buffer with
 * red and blue swapped once the surface id has shown a shared-memory one in that HMI run):
 * - GPU buffers (zero-copy): dmabufs GL draws into (embed_gl.c), given to the compositor with wl_drm's
 *   create_prime_buffer. Made when the compositor offers wl_drm with PRIME and XRGB8888, and the renderer's
 *   own GL can draw into dmabufs; the compositor accepting them completes the setup.
 * - shared-memory buffers (wl_shm): written on the CPU, without GPU buffers (GL frames read back,
 *   display-bridge's pixel apps' frames).
