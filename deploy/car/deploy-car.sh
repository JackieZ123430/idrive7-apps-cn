# deploy-car.sh - install the custom apps on a real BMW MGU head unit,
#                 persistently, with a full backup and a one-command restore.
#
# Copy this whole folder to the unit (USB stick or push-to-car.sh) and run as
# root from inside it:
#
#   sh deploy-car.sh check      dry run: checks the unit, lists every file that
#                               would be touched, test-builds the MainApp patch.
#                               Changes nothing.
#   sh deploy-car.sh install    1. backs up EVERY file it is going to touch and
#                                  verifies the backup (aborts if it can't)
#                               2. enables the custom-app provisioning hook,
#                                  persistent across reboots
#                               3. installs/updates every apps/*.mgu this unit accepts (one it refuses is left out)
#                               4. restarts the app platform once and verifies
#                                  (REBOOT_NEXT=1: not - the caller reboots the head unit
#                                  right after, which restarts it anyway: one restart, not two)
#                               5. reboots the head unit if the controller gate
#                                  (Doom) was just set up: it loads at start
#                                  (NO_REBOOT=1: not now, at the next drive)
#   sh deploy-car.sh restore    puts every touched file back exactly as it was
#                               before the FIRST install (the "stock" backup),
#                               removes the installed apps and the hook.

# MainApp's own /usr/lib/oap-mainapp/src/main.js is never written: the patched
# copy is bind-mounted over it at boot, and only while that file is unchanged
# (after a firmware update the hook switches itself off).
#
# Backups are kept in TWO places: ./backups/ next to this script and
# /var/opt/public/mgu_custom_backup/ on the unit. The first one ever made is the
# "stock" backup and is never overwritten; restore uses it by default.
